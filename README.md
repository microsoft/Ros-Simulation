# Introduction

The ROS Simulator is an orchestration system created to simulate autonomous robots in a virtual world at high scale. This README outlines the tools and the steps required to modify, build, and deploy the project.

For instructions for how to set up your simulation locally or on an Azure cluster, please refer to our docs:
